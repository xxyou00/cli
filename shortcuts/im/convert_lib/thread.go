// roots into ~10s of latency — the same multiplier that motivated the
// reactions enrichment fan-out. GET /messages has no published per-app
// rate-limit anywhere near these levels, so we set this higher than the
// reactions batch_query cap (which sits at 4 to stay well under the
// gateway-layer 50/s + 1000/min explicit ceiling on the reactions endpoint).

// ExpandThreadReplies fetches and embeds thread replies for messages that contain a thread_id.
// For each unique thread_id found in messages, it fetches up to perThread replies (asc order)
// and attaches them as "thread_replies" on the first outer message that referenced that thread.
// Expansion stops once totalLimit cumulative replies have been allocated across planned fetches.
// nameCache is the shared open_id→name map.
//
// Implementation is two-phase:
//
//  1. Plan + concurrent fetch. Walk messages in order, recording every
//     unique thread_id with a fetch limit of perThread (no upfront budget
//     deduction — see below). Then dispatch the planned fetches with
//     bounded concurrency; each goroutine writes only to its own result
//     slot, no shared mutable state besides that slot.
//
//  2. Sequential attach with post-hoc budget enforcement. Walk the planned
//     threads in their original first-seen order, accumulating actual
//     returned reply counts against totalLimit. When a thread's actual
//     replies would push the running total past totalLimit, its reply slice
//     is truncated to fit the remaining budget and thread_has_more is set
//     on its host so consumers know more replies exist server-side. Threads
//     that arrive past a fully-exhausted budget keep their thread_id on the
//     host but don't get thread_replies attached (semantically identical to
//     the pre-existing serial behavior for over-budget threads). The phase
//     stays single-threaded because ResolveSenderNames writes to the shared
//     nameCache and FormatMessageItem may trigger merge_forward expansion
//     that also touches nameCache.
//
// Budget semantics match the pre-existing serial implementation exactly:
// each thread's actual returned count is what gets deducted from the
// budget, not its planned per-thread ceiling. An earlier draft of this
// refactor allocated the budget against the planned ceiling upfront for
// implementation simplicity, but that silently dropped later threads in
// chats where many threads return well under perThread replies (e.g.
// totalLimit=500 + perThread=50 + 12 short threads of 3 replies each → old
// code attached all 12, planned-allocation code attached only 10). The
// trade-off here is a small amount of server-side over-fetching for
// threads that will end up truncated or dropped — bounded by perThread per
// thread — in exchange for preserving the original "every thread that fits
// gets its data" guarantee.
